# Updates

March 8, 2023: Added Stata version number and submitted package to SSC. Also updated a reference in the help file. 

December 31, 2022: Fixed a bug that led to an error with subsetting syntax. Please run the updated code if you previously specified "if" or "in" as part of your rdmse command -- apologies for the inconvenience. Credit to Melle Albada at Vienna University of Economics and Business for alerting me to this error. 

July 1, 2022: Fixed a minor bug that returned an error message when kernel was specified as "triangular" as opposed to "tri". Credit to Tomoaki Tanaka (MRes/PhD student at the Queen Mary University of London) for alerting me to this error.
